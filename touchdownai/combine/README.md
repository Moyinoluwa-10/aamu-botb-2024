## Description
These notebook analyses data abot NFL statistics, statistics, participation, as well as the draft and combine. We used a Random Forest Classifier Model is to utilise old combine stats from drafted prospects to help predict the performance and likelihood of a current draft prospect.

This feature of TouchdownAI is similar to the play by play and will also drive fan engagement on the NFL app, specifically during the off-season, by giving users data driven predictions on players they are interested in in the Combine.
