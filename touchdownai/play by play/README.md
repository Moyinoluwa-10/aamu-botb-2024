# Team Alabama A&M University - HBCU Battle of the Brains

#Play by Play

## Description
This notebook analyses play by play data from 2022 and 2023, and does a comprehensive analysis of both. We used a Linear Regression model to predict the average yards gained per play based on a team's average yards per game and touchdowns per game, an engineered feature based on features available in the dataset. We also worked through a Team Win Probability Model using a Random Forest Classifier as well as a simple predictive analysis for fantasy football using a Random Forest Regressor model.

All this information will be used in TouchdownAI to drive user engagement by providing predictions for points that a certain player might get based on past data. Another use case would be for subscribers also using Fantasy football to get predicted fantasy points, as shown in the example below.
