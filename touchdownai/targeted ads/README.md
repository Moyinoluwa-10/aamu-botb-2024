#Targeted Ads

## Description
This notebook initialises simulated data and uses it in a Decision Tree model to predict a users watch pattern and give targeted ads based on that information. This will be useful in TouchdownAI in the NFL app to give users advertisements that they are more likely to interact with and therefore drag revenue for the NFL.

## Data Sources
